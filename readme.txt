Widget listing only top level categories.

== Description ==

Widget listing only top level categories.

Currently it is preset to following behavior:

* Show unordered list of top-level categories
* Skip category with ID 1 (usually the "Default" category)
* Don't hide empty categories
* Order categories by their ID (order of creation)

The only customizable thing is the widget title... for now.

Developed for private use, but has perspective for more extensive usage. I can't guarantee any support in the future nor further development, but it is to be expected. Kindly inform me about bugs, if you find any, or propose new features: zaantar@zaantar.eu.
